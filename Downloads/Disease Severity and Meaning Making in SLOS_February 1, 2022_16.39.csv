Our youngest son has developed a compassion for all kids and always tries to help others because thats what we all do for our family. Colton is so quickly witty with us, sometimes it gets him in trouble with others.  He gets fixated on things; how a roomba operates, how a dishwasher breaks, how an oven works, he has to study every intricate detail and piece of machinery and he's really intelligent with these topics and he loves to build replicas of the intricate details of these machines and it's fascinating to see.

He doesn't seem to understand embarrassment or understand when we say certain things he can hurt another's feelings and he's very literal.  If you ask him a question, I  typically caution people because he doesn't have a filter and WILL tell the truth, which is an awesome quality, I don't think he has any capability of lying, even if he thought he'd get in trouble or for any reason, he has always told the truth. For example: His grandma who is somewhat sensitive asked if he liked dinner she made, his response, ""no, it was really gross but i tried one bite of everything."" Or if you tell him an idiom, he typically will not understand it, for example before we taught him some of those concepts, if I was in a hurry, I'd say, ""Come on kids, we have to hit the pavement."" Colton literally went outside and smacked the concrete driveway.  We get a lot of laughs from him, though at the age of 10 he has remembered what we have told him and now knows what many mean.  Sometimes, I think I need to be more like him, never in a hurry, stops and spots things here and there to observe, and always tells the truth.",1
